# FullstackOpen
Welcome to my Fullstack Development repository! This is where I document my journey as I learn the ins and outs of fullstack development. 
Here you'll find a collection of exercises, mini applications, and projects that I've worked on to enhance my skills. 
Feel free to explore the code, learn from it, and provide feedback if you find something interesting or if you have suggestions for improvement.

This repository serves as a hands-on learning journal for fullstack development. From frontend to backend, I'm exploring 
various technologies, frameworks, and best practices to build robust and scalable web applications. 
Whether it's creating a simple to-do list app or diving into more complex projects, I'm committed to 
expanding my skill set and sharing my progress with the community.


I'm actively working with a range of technologies, and this list will grow as my journey continues. Some of the technologies you'll find in this repository include:

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Redux, TypeScript, and more.
Backend: Node.js, GraphQL, REST APIs, and more.
Databases: MongoDB, and more.
